### 2 Core `Mission` Question - How can we `maximize` learner transformation in 10,440 hours?
 - We are co-responsible for producing `remarkable` behavioural traits such as `deep inquiry` (self-generated questions, curiosity, research), an `intrinsic desire for uncomfortable struggle` (for employable skills, specific interests, big ideas) and an `inclusive mindset` (real-world projects, collaboration, compassion).

### 3 En`Vision`ed Future - _"More genius per genius"_  
To be recognized as the **`#1`** engineering institution regionally and nationally, by all stakeholders, including employers, faculty and society.
