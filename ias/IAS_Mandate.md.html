<p>Modelled along the same lines as EPIC - English</p>
<p>Inspiration is CodeChef <strong>DSA</strong> certification - <a href="https://www.codechef.com/certification/data-structures-and-algorithms/about">https://www.codechef.com/certification/data-structures-and-algorithms/about</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms is the heart of learning Computer Science. Today, in the IT industry, there is a vast shortage of professionals who have a command on this subject. In fact,  <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/95-engineers-in-india-unfit-for-software-development-jobs-study/article9652211.ece">recent studies</a>  have corroborated our belief that a vast majority of engineers in India <strong>are unfit for software development jobs</strong>, a fact that we identified and took on to fix 9 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While the subject is taught in most Engineering Colleges in the country, there is hardly <strong>any standard that is being followed in the assessment of the skill levels</strong>. We believe that a Certification provided by the global experts in the subject will provide a good ground for the students and professionals to assess themselves. It also provides the software industry a standard to benchmark against and get access to the best students out there. More importantly it provides a level playing ground to every software student and professional to choose a career path that she wants to.</p>
