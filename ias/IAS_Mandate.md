#  EPIC for Coding 
Modelled along the same lines as EPIC - English 

Inspiration is CodeChef **DSA** certification - https://www.codechef.com/certification/data-structures-and-algorithms/about

> The grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms is the heart of learning Computer Science. Today, in the IT industry, there is a vast shortage of professionals who have a command on this subject. In fact,  [recent studies](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/95-engineers-in-india-unfit-for-software-development-jobs-study/article9652211.ece)  have corroborated our belief that a vast majority of engineers in India *are unfit for software development jobs*, a fact that we identified and took on to fix 9 years ago.

> While the subject is taught in most Engineering Colleges in the country, *there is hardly any standard that is being followed* in the assessment of the skill levels. We believe that a Certification provided by the global experts in the subject will provide a good ground for the students and professionals to assess themselves. It also provides the software industry a standard to benchmark against and get access to the best students out there. More importantly it provides a level playing ground to every software student and professional to choose a career path that she wants to.

# Final Year Projects

_"Automation First. Intelligent Automation next."_ 

**Main theme:** We will develop students to gain a good perspective of the "Automation First" paradigm and then move them into the "Intelligent Automation (using AI)" paradigm. 

  ## SIH 2019 RPA winning projects 
  
  -  To be re-cycled and developed into full projects / mini-projects
  -  Mentoring between winners, KITE students and faculty ownership
